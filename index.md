    * Developed this web app which enables a user to search any professional soccer player and view information and statistics (number of goals, assists, matches/minutes played, tackles, etc.) about that player, compare up to 4 players, and make a list of favorite players (requires sign in).
    * Built entirely using the ReactJS framework (utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and data gathered from an API and datasets from Kaggle. Incorporated concepts/tools like ES6, bootstrap, react-router, responsive CSS, etc.
    * Used Google Firebase for hosting application, data storage, and user authentication.
